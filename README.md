####Usage
It is difficult to seperate the project as a library, therefore please take a look at the `ListViewFragment.java` and `ScrollViewFragment.java` and add what you need here.
If you want to change the layout, please edit `activity_main.xml`.
If you want to use it in a `Activity`, please refer to `MainActivity`, or if you want to use it in a `Fragment`, please refer to `MainFragment`.

###Andriod滑动无缝切换的ViewPager
带有HeaderView的ViewPager，如Android5.0的系统自带联系人的布局（或者Google Play的布局），滑动的时候，优先滑动HeaderView再滑动ViewPager，滑动无缝对接，不需要分两次完成。可用在Activity和Fragment上（参考Demo）.
